This is a project on marketing campaign and customer behaviour prediction.

Reports and presentations can be viewed in the reports folder.



This project takes data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/edith2021/bank-marketing-campaign)

The target variable is y, representing whether or not the customer signed up for the new product being offered during the marketing campaign {1="yes,0="no"} . This project's main purpose is to train a model to predict whether or not an individual will sign up for the new product based on information such as current balance, age, gender, and more.

As the target variable is categorical, classification methods and models will be used to solve the problems above.
